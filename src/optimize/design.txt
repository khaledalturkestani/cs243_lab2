- Pseudo code for implementation of FindRedundantNullChecks.java:
Direction: forward.
Meet: intersection (of OUT of all predecessors).
entry: Empty
IN = Meet
OUT = IN + NULL_CHECKED_REGISTER (need to make sure that it's a null check operation in the quad)
Transfer Func: if register being null checked is in IN --> add its QUAD_ID to global HashSet of quad ids.
